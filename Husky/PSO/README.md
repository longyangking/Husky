# Particle Swarm Optimization

## Features
+ Single-goal objective/Pareto-based Multi-objective optimization
+ Exchange particles among different groups
+ Multiple Linear/Nonlinear Constraints and Integer Constraints
+ Automatic Stop

## TODO
+ Quantum transport
+ Adaptive Velocity Weight and Personal/Social Coefficients
+ Messy Code
+ External iteration handle function
+ Parallel computation
+ Plot options
+ Automatically adaptive parameter Setting (with Machine Learning)
+ Robust Constraint Handling Algorithms
+ Python 3 support
